summary: I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Barcelona, in the group of Xavier Barril (http://www.ub.edu/bl).<br> During my PhD thesis I worked on the development of different Structure-Based Drug Design methods with the aim to improve drug design for non-standard targets.<br>Currently, I am mainly focused in exciting collaborative projects in the field of epigenetics and cancer, where I am applying such methods and also learning new experimental skills, such as protein expression and purification and different biophysical assays.
